                                 TEST
1)	JAVA: java is a high level object  oriented programming language 
          It is platform independent
          It is open source and free to use.
		  the command java used to run the code
		  
    javac: javac is a compiler 
           used to convert .java file to .class file
           it coverts source code to byte code.
          the command javac used to compile the source code
		  
2)   JVM : Java Vertual machine
       The main tasks of jvm are:
       * It loads the byte code 
       * It verifies the byte code 
       * It execute the byte code.
    It also provides run time environment to the byte code.

     JRE: Java Run time Environment	
	     JRE contains JVM + Set of libraries
		 it is minimum required to execute the java code or byte code.
	
     JDK : Java Development kit
          it consists of JRE + Development tools like docs ,javac etc....

3)		Array limitations
      array is use to store multiple data/ values in a single variable
      It reduce the more refVariable
	  We can also store similar data in a one variable

5).java file : .java file is source code 
               it is the actual code what programmer done.
  .class file : .class file is byte code 
               It exists only when the .java file get compiled.

7)Java:	java is a high level object  oriented programming language 
          It is platform independent
          It is open source and free to use.

9) Variable : variable is a container which is used to store the data , and can be used in further program.
     there are 4 types of variable
     * static variable : static variable are declared out side the main method using a word static.
	 
     * instance variable : variables declared inside the class and out side the body of method
	 
     * local variable  : local variables are declared inside the main method 
	 
     * parameter variable: are declared inside the paranthesis of the method.	 
	 
10)keywords
    extends , new ,abstract,return,break, default,static , void , class,private	 
	 
	 
11) class level variable :
    variables are initialised inside the class 

12) DataTypes:

     the dataTypes used to represents the type of data to be stored in a variable.
    types of data type:
    * primitive dataType : primitive dataTypes are pre defined and they have a value which is defined
                          The starting letter should be in lowercase	
    ex: int , byte, char , float, boolean ,double, long ,

     * non primitive dataTypes: non primitive dataypes are defined by programmer	and values are  not defined
	                            the starting letter should be in upperCase
	 ex: String , Array, and all the class names what programmer write,
	 
14) Java features:
    * It is platform independent
    * It is open source and free to use.
	* It is secure and powerfull 
	* It is High level programming language
